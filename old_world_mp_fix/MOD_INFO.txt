# Old World MP-Fix

Fixes multiplayer desync issues in **The Old World Campaign** and **Old World Classic** mods.

## Problem
The Old World endgame scripts use non-deterministic `pairs()` iteration, causing different execution order on two clients. This leads to desync around turn 20-30 when endgames trigger.

## Solution
Replaces 4 endgame script files with MP-safe versions using sorted iteration, ensuring identical execution order on all clients.

## Installation
1. Subscribe to this mod
2. In Mod Manager, ensure load order:
   - The Old World Campaign (top)
   - Old World MP-Fix (below it)
3. Start NEW campaign

## Compatibility
âœ… The Old World Campaign
âœ… Old World Classic submod
âœ… SFO: Grimhammer III
âœ… Other mods (unless they also override endgame scripts)

## What Changes?
- Army spawn order (now alphabetic instead of random)
- Mission objective order (now sorted)

## What Does NOT Change?
- Balance (same army counts and strength)
- Which factions spawn
- Victory conditions
- Gameplay mechanics

## Multiplayer Requirements
ðŸŽ® BOTH players need this mod
ðŸŽ® Identical load order
ðŸŽ® Start NEW campaign (old saves may have divergence)

## Technical Details
Fixed files:
- endgame_wild_hunt.lua (1 pairs() â†’ sorted)
- endgame_grudge_too_far.lua (1 pairs() â†’ sorted)
- endgame_vampires_rise.lua (1 pairs() â†’ sorted)
- endgame_vermintide.lua (3 pairs() â†’ sorted)

Total: 6 non-deterministic iterations replaced with sorted iteration.
